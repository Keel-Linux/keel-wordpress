"""Ask for the WordPress values that the inithooks conf did not provide.

Called by firstboot.d/40wordpress only when a terminal is attached and a value
is absent; prints one KEY=value line per requested name on stdout so the hook
keeps the decisions and this file keeps the dialogs. On a headless first boot
the hook fails instead of calling this, because the values it needs are
declared: secrets.app_password and secrets.db_password of the instance
description.
