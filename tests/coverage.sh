# Line coverage of the shell this project writes, measured with kcov over
# the bats suite (decision 0004). The measured files are the first boot
# library, the first boot hook itself, the two operator commands the overlay
# ships, the logic of the boot test, the build time archive checks and the
# script that enables the signed archive; the bar of
# decision 0003 applies to all of them. Exits 1 below the threshold, 2 when a
# tool is missing. tests/boot-test.sh is the thin main that runs keel and LXC
# as root and is exercised by the container run in test-appliance.yml, not
# measured here; conf.d/main needs a chroot, a network and half an hour.
