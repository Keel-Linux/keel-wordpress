# bin/wordpress.py draws its dialog on the terminal, not in the hook's pipe.
#
# firstboot.d/40wordpress reads the script's standard output for KEY=value,
# and dialog draws its screen on standard output. On 2026-09-30 a
# keel-wordpress first boot on Proxmox froze at a password box because the box
# was drawn into that pipe. These tests run the script as the hook does,
# output redirected, inside a real pseudo terminal (script(1)), with a
# stand-in for libinithooks whose dialog refuses to draw anywhere but a
# terminal.
